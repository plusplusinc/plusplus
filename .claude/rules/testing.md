# Testing

Swift Testing (`@Test`, `#expect`, `#require`) for everything except UI automation and
performance, which stay on XCTest by Apple's own guidance.

Put a test in the cheapest tier that can hold it: package tests on macOS (milliseconds, no
simulator) before anything that needs UIKit, and snapshots before XCUITest.

- Tests that need UIKit are wrapped in `#if canImport(UIKit) && !os(watchOS)` so `swift test`
  on macOS compiles them out; the simulator run exercises them.
- Snapshots go through `assertThemedSnapshots(of:width:)` in `DesignSystemTests`, which owns
  the explicit width, the perceptual precision, and the light, dark, and XXXL appearances. Do
  not call `assertSnapshot` directly. Re-record by deleting the files under `__Snapshots__/`.
- Display name on the attribute, stable identifier on the function:
  `@Test("An in-memory container round-trips a model") func inMemoryRoundTrip()`. The
  formatter is configured to keep it that way (see `.swiftformat`).
- No sleeping in tests. Use clocks, confirmations, or injected schedulers.
- A bug fix comes with a test that failed before the fix.
